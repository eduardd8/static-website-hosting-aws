Throughout this project I have produced and deployed a static website that features my resume which is running on serverless cloud infrastructure.

The website is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and continuously deployed to an S3 bucket and cloudfront CDN.

The managing and provisioning of resources has been made using infrastructure as code (IaC) with the help of the open-source framework AWS SAM.
